          A full refresh of our main website has been in the works for a few years now. We started out in 2018 as a music blog covering the local scene, with a spotlight on what was happening at the Rabbit Hole in Plaza Midwood (now Jack&#39;s Live). Artists like Jeff Austin, Billy Strings, Marcus King, Jon Stickley, and countless others were gracing the stageâ€”yet no one in Charlotte was really shining a light on it (and they still aren&#39;t).

          Fast forward to the COVID pandemic in 2020: we decided to pivot and start selling our own tickets for shows booked by my friend and partner Ryan Williams through Time2Fly Music. Records On The Wall also began co-promoting any shows Ryan booked. In 2022, Ryan moved to Denver, and I gradually took on booking responsibilities here in Charlotte, while Ryan continued building a presence in Denver.

          Today, we&#39;re set up to keep booking the best local and national talent we can get our hands on.
